## Description

When school gets hard and people need to relax, some UM students look for social activities within the student clubs on campus. However, why is it so damn hard to know what is going on in the University?

**Club Connect** offers a solution to this by getting all the club events in one single space. You will be able to filter through which club's activities you want to see and the page acts as a portal to all the events that you want to be part of.

## Running (for now)

While, ideally, this page will be hosted online for everybody to see, for now and for the sake of this Hackathon you will have to run it using the React.js environment.

I hope you can run `npm`, because to see this final result please run this command from the directory `club-connect` in this repo.
